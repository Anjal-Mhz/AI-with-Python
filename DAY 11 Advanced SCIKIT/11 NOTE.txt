    TYPE OF OUTPUT THEY PREDICT

1   CLASSIFICATION
catagoize input data into predefined class or categories (discrete)
(example yes or no,spam or not, iris data, pass or fail, predict dog or not)


2   REGRESSION (creates relationship)
to predict continuous numerical value based on input vairables
(example weather_forecast, stock price,house price)

Dependent variables (Y) and independent variables (X)
Y is being predicted and X is used to predict the dependent variable

Simple regression
deals with single indepedent and depedent variables

Nonlinear regression
curve line

Multiple regression
deals with multiple X Y variables

In short
Classification is like telling them which bus to take 
(a specific route, like "bus 10" or "bus 20").
Regression is like telling them how much the fare will cost 
(a numerical value, like "$2.50")


    DIFFERENT MODELS FOR MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM

1. DECISION TREE
A decision tree in machine learning is a flowchart-like structure that models decision-making by branching out based on features or conditions
Nodes : root node, internal nodes, leaf nodes

2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful set of supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression
terms: Margin, hyperplane or decision bounary, support vectors, kernel

3. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
Logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm used primarily for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability of an instance belonging to one of two classes

4. LINEAR REGRESSION
Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on one or more independent variables (features) by establishing a linear relationship between them



        METRIC
a metric is a quantitative measure used to evaluate the performance of a model

1.Classification metric

    1.Accuracy
        (The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances)
    2.Precision:
        Measures the accuracy of positive predictions, indicating what proportion of predicted positives are actually positive. 
    3.Recall (Sensitivity):
        Measures the model's ability to identify all relevant positive instances, indicating what proportion of actual positives were correctly identified. 
    4.F1-score:
        The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure when both are important. 
    5.Confusion matrix
        A table showing the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions



2.Regression metric

    1.Mean Squared error(MSE)
        The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values
    2.Root mean squared error (RMSE)
        The square root of MSE, providing a measure in the original units of the target variable
    3.R-squared 
        The proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s)



3....there are other different metric like clustering, ranking etc
